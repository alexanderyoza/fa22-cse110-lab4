1. Console will print 3 because i in the for loop have a global scope.
2. Console will print 150 since 300 * 0.5 = 150
3. Console will print 150 since 300 * 0.5 = 150 and 150 rounded is 150.
4. [50, 100, 150]. It contains all the elements in the parameter list multiplied by 0.5
5. Error, no i variable exists in the scope.
6. Error, no discountedPrice variable exists in the scope.
7. Console will print 150 since finalScope is in the the vairable is in the scope.
8. [50, 100, 150]. Same as Q4 since its in the scope.
9. Error, no i variable exists in the scope.
10. 3 since the length is 3 and its value is set on line 4.
11. [50, 100, 150]. You can change the contents of an Array even if it is const.
12. 
    A. student['name'] 

    B. student['Grad Year'] 

    C. student'greeting' 

    D. student['Favorite Teacher']['name'] 

    E. student['courseLoad'][0]

13. 
    A. '32', concatenation
    
    B. 1, 3-2 = 1, 3 is mapped to an int val
    
    C. 3, essentially 3+0
    
    D. '3null', concatenation 
   
    E. 4, becomes 1+3
    
    F. 0, essentially 0 + 0 since false maps to 0 and null is nothing
   
    G. '3undefined', concatenation
    
    H. NaN, undefined cannot be subtracted

14. 
    A. true, because 2 > 1 
    
    B. false, '2' > '1'
    
    C. true, they are compared without a strict typecheck
    
    D. false, they are compared with a strict typecheck so since they are different types they are different.
    
    E. false, true is 1 as an integer and 1 is not equal to 2
    
    F. true, Boolean(2) is equal to true

15. == does not consider the type. === means both must have the same type and value to be true.

16. See ./part2-question16.js

17. [2, 4, 6]. modifyArray calls doSomething() on each element in the array which multiplies it by 2

18. See ./part2-question18.js

19. 1 4 3 2. Lines 2 and 3 are delayed with the setTimeout() function.
